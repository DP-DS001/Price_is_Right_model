# Price is Right: A Regression Model

Is the Price Right? We’ll enter the exciting world of The Price is Right, but with a scientific approach. 
A model will be made to help exit out of the contestant's row and onto the stage. A mixture of data analysis, modeling, and game theory will be used. 
There will be a dataset of Price is Right statistics used, as well as a dataset of amazon products to help train the model. 
 
I have always had an interest in game theory and the Price is Right, so being able to merge this with data science proved to be interesting. 
Contestant’s row is of particular interest. In this part of the game show, four contestants have the chance to bid on a prize and who comes closest to the actual retail price without going over wins, and moves on to play another game on stage.
 
Can we build an effective model to win our way out of contestant’s row on the Price is Right?
